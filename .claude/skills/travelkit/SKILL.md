# TravelKit Flight Skill

Keep consumer replies in Simplified Chinese unless the user requests another language. Load only the smallest reference needed for the current step; do not preload shared references unless the active workflow points to them.

## Fast Routing

| User intent | Read | Tool(s) |
|---|---|---|
| Search or compare flights | [flight-search](references/flight-search.md) | `flight_search` |
| Price a known flight number | [flight-pricing](references/flight-pricing.md) | `flight_pricing` |
| User selects a search option | [flight-verify](references/flight-verify.md) | `flight_verify_solution` |
| Create an order after verified price | [flight-create-order](references/flight-create-order.md) | `flight_create_order` |
| Pay an order | [flight-pay-order](references/flight-pay-order.md) | `flight_pay_order` |
| Look up orders | [flight-order-lookup](references/flight-order-lookup.md) | `flight_order_detail`, `flight_order_detail_by_external_id`, `flight_order_list` |
| Invoice application | [flight-invoice](references/flight-invoice.md) | `flight_get_order_invoice_application`, `flight_create_order_invoice_application` |
| Cancel an order | [flight-cancel](references/flight-cancel.md) | `flight_cancel_order` |
| Refund | [flight-refund](references/flight-refund.md) | `flight_refund_quote`, `flight_refund_money_search`, `flight_refund_request`, `flight_refund_confirm` |
| Change flight | [flight-change](references/flight-change.md) | `flight_change_search`, `flight_change_request` |
| Download itinerary | [flight-itinerary](references/flight-itinerary.md) | `flight_download_itinerary` |
| API key / credential issues | [mcp-connection](references/mcp-connection.md) | N/A |

## Core Rules

- Search before booking; verify real-time price before collecting passenger information or creating an order.
- Never expose internal fields such as `solutionId`, `orderKey`, confirmation flags, raw MCP JSON, API keys, `passengerIds`, `segmentIds`, or idempotency keys to normal users.
- Normal user-visible replies must never contain `PNR`, `airlinePnr`, airline PNR, `票号/PNR`, or `票号 / PNR`; omit or rewrite those fields even if returned, empty, or present in an error message.
- If `TRAVELKIT_API_KEY` is missing or invalid, treat it only as a platform-managed credential issue. Never invent or output local MCP configuration snippets such as `mcpServers`, `npx`, stdio server setup, or local config JSON.
- Never invent missing tool data. If baggage, refund/change policy, ticketing, deadline, fees, or status data is absent, say it was not returned.
- For order creation, order lookup, and post-payment checks, use [output-rules](references/output-rules.md): total price = fare + tax.
- Search/pricing/verify/order lookup/invoice lookup/itinerary/change-search/refund quote are read operations and can be called as needed.
- Create order, pay, cancel, create invoice application, refund request/confirm, and change request are write operations; get explicit user confirmation for the exact action first.
- Search stage collects only route, dates, passenger counts, cabin, and preferences. Collect ID/passport/phone/email only after price verification succeeds and the user confirms they want to proceed.

## Write Confirmation

Before any write tool, summarize the business action and wait for explicit confirmation. After confirmation, set required internal confirmation fields without asking users about production or technical flags. Read [confirmation-rules](references/confirmation-rules.md) only when preparing a write operation.
